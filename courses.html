                        I was able to get a hold of the basics of this new syntax, and conceptualize the logic behind the code.

                    <p>1209 was the second half to 1109 in many ways, one of which emphasized the importance of taking an object-oriented approach
                        to any programming task. I find that I do best with structure and routine, so reshaping my 'spaghetti code' mindset was crucial to succeeding in that class.

                    <p>Although a challenging elective, I found that 1267 offered me my first real application of the C++ and Python concepts
                        that I had gained in earlier semesters. It was satisfying to the vision for my code take shape in such vibrant ways.

                    <p>I recall with great clarity how nervious I was at enrolling for this course. Similar to 1267, 2200 was another practical application
                        of the object-oriented programming concepts that I had become familiar with, but this time projects were based around the Raspberry Pi
                        and it's various peripherals.

                    <p>My favourite course by far, and the most challenging I've taken at Douglas College prior to transferring.
                        2300 really pushed me to scale up my conceptual thinking in order to truly grasp the intangible data structures
                        and algorithms that were being discussed. This course relied heavily on discrete mathematics, which added to the challenge.
