    This is the start of the main navigation bar that should
    be seen (and accessable) on the left of all pages. This may
    need to be tweaked to appear on all other pates. Note the 
    individual links to each of the three main pages (excluding
    'Home') in the navbar.

    Editorial note: further comments will appear in large blocks that 
    relate to the code immediately below them. I don't like to clutter
    my lines with a bunch of comments, but if needed I'll resort to this.

    ALSO: color code #8f6bfb is the main theme for this website. It looks
    sooo good with a linear gradient (see styles.css for how it's used).

                <li>My name is Tyrese Temple and I'm an aspiring software engineer with a passion for building software that focues on transparency, simplicity, and security. 
                    Currently, I'm a student at Simon Fraser University, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (Software Systems). 
                </li>
                <li>Within the realm of technology, I am particularly interested in anything that concerns security, vulnerability disclosure, and hacking.
                    Additionally, I'm an advocate for the use of open source software, data sovereignty for all users regardless of one's personal ideals, 
                    and upcycling of old technology into the new and innovative products of tomorrow.
                </li>
                <li>However, my experience with the practical side of my education and interests is limited at best. That is to say, I'm still an amateur in the field of software development, 
                    but I am constantly trying to learn and improve my skills. I always hope to learn from those around me, and try to see into the weakness of familiar applications and software
                    so as to potentially make them better with my own ideas and solutions.

        instead of reveal personal images that I'm not really confortable sharing. I hope that the reel
